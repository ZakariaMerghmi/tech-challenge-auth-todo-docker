# 🛡️ Fullstack JWT Auth + Todo App

**Fullstack JWT Auth + Todo App** is a containerized full-stack app with JWT authentication, a secure Todo API, and a beautiful React frontend styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It’s designed to demonstrate how to build microservices with Docker, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and React.

This project combines secure user registration/login, protected CRUD operations, and a minimal yet clean UI for a practical developer experience.
