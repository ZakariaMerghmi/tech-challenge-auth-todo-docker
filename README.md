# Auth + Todo System (Backend Challenge)

This project is a simple containerized full-stack application composed of:

- ✅ **User Service (Authentication + JWT)**
- ✅ **Todo Service (CRUD API protected by JWT)**
- ✅ **Frontend** (Minimal UI to interact with both services)
- ✅ **Docker Compose setup** for full local orchestration
- ✅ **Postman collection** for API testing
- ✅ **Unit tests** included for critical endpoints
